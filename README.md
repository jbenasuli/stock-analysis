## Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions

What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

- There is a detailed statement on the advantages and disadvantages of refactoring code in general (3 pt).

How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?

- There is a detailed statement on the advantages and disadvantages of the original and refactored VBA script (3 pt).

### Advantages

The primary advantage to refactoring the original VBA script is the reduction in execution time. As detailed above, the time needed for script to run for each year is drastically lower. For 2017 the execution time was reduced by 73.7%, and for 2018 the execution time was reduced by 75.3%.

- Disadvantages:
